1. Create a python file named Square, write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any given square 

        Hint: side need to be given to calculate the area and perimeter of square
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                    side = 5

                output:
                    Area of the square is equal to 25
                    Perimeter of square is equal to 20
                
2. Create a python file named Rectangle, write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any given Rectangle

        Hint: width and length need to be given to calculate the area and perimeter of rectangle
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                    length = 5
                    width = 2

                output:
                    Area of the rectangle is equal to 10
                    Perimeter of rectangle is equal to 20

3. Create a python file named KgToPounds, write a program that can convert kg to pounds 
            Hints: 1 kg = 2.2 pounds

            Ex:
                Given data:
                    kg = 100

                output:
                    100 kg is equal to 220 pounds

4. Create a class named GallonsToLitters, Write a program that can convert gallon (int) to litter (double)
            Hints: 1 gallon = 3.79 litters
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                     gallon = 10

                output:
                    10 gallon is equal to 37.9 litters

5. create a python file named Phone Number and declare the following variables:
            countryCode, areaCode, localNumber

            use string concatenation to display the phone number
            ex:
                if  countryCode = 1
                    areaCode = 703
                    localNumber = 4512625

                output:
                    Your phone number is +1(703)-4512625

6. Create a python file named BirthDay and create the following variable
             name, birthDay, birthMonth, birthYear

             use concatenation to display the birthday of the person

                 if  name = "John"
                     birthDay = 25
                     birthMonth = "April"
                     birthYear = 1995;

                 output:
                     John was born on April/25/1995.
