    which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number,
    for numbers which are a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number and for
    numbers which are a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead of the number. 
        
        ex: 
            output:
                1 2 FIN 4 RA FIN 7 8 FIN RA 11 FIN 13 14 FINRA 16 17 FIN
