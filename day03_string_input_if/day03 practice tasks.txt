1.  Given a number grade level determine and print which school type the person is in is in.
            grade level and types are:
                    1-5: Elementary school 
                    6-8: Middle school
                    9-12: High school
                    13-16: College
                    17-18: Grad School

              Assume that the given number is 1 ~ 18


   2. Create a python file named MaxNumber, Write a program that can print the maximum number between two numbers, if both are equal then print Equal

            Ex:
                n1= 100, n2 = 200;

            output:
                200 is the maximum number


    3. Create a python file named MinNumber, Write a program that can print the minimum number between two numbers, if both are equal then print Equal

            Ex:
                n1= 100, n2 = 200;

            output:
                100 is the minimum number


    4 . Create a class called FizzBuzz, an integer variable named number is given to you,
   		write a program that prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, prints "Buzz" if
   		the number is divisible by 5, and prints FizzBuzz if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

            Ex:
                number 15

            Output:
                FizzBuzz


    5.  HTTP is the protocol that governs communications between web-servers and web clients.
    	Part of the protocol includes a status code returned by the server to tell the browser
    	the status of its most recent page request. Some of the codes and their meanings are listed below:

            status codes and their meanings: 
	                200, OK
	                201, Created
	                202, Accepted
	                301, Moved Permanently
	                303, See Other
	                304, Not Modified
	                307, Temporary Redirect
	                400, Bad Request
	                401, Unauthorized
	                403, Forbidden
	                404, Not Found
	                410, Gone
	                500, Internal Server Error
	                503, Service Unavailable

 
         declare an int variable named statusCode, and a vlaid status code is already given
         write a program that prints out, on a line by itself, the appropriate label from the above list based on status.
